 *
 * Ambiguity tie-break (deliberately simpler than the backend): server/channel
 * names aren't unique in the schema, and the backend surfaces 2+ name matches
 * as a `hint`-carrying 400 the caller must resolve. This function does NOT
 * replicate that — it takes the FIRST match in `directory`/`channels` array
 * order (plain `Array.prototype.find` semantics) and stops. A duplicate-name
 * collision is rare, and the consequence here is just "click navigates to the
 * other same-named channel" — not data loss — so this is an accepted,
 * documented simplification, not a bug.
 *
 * Returns `null` on any miss (unknown server, unknown channel, or malformed
 * ref) — this is the false-positive guard the caller (`describeChannelRefPillView`)
 * relies on to fall back to plain text instead of rendering a broken pill.
